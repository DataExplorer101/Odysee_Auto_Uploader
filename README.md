# Odysee_Auto_Uploader
UPLOADS YT VIDS TO ODYSEE

So for this to work, start by using YouTube-DL to download all videos, thumbnails, and descriptions of videos. Don't rename them. I don't *think* the video
format should matter, so long as Odysee can accept it.
Then use firefox, go to the playlist, right click, click "save as" change to "text files" from dropdown menu and make sure the file name ends in .txt instead
of .html
Then run it with python3.8
This build is not exactly stable. You've been warned.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
